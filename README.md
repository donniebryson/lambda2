# lambda2
Warning! This is not production ready code. It is only a test run of using AWS Lambda to detect when a file is uploaded to a S3 bucket, start an EC2 instance, run a python data science script that processes the file and writes out the result to another S3 bucket, then shuts down the EC2 instance.
